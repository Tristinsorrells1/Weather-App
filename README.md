## Introduction
First, thank you for the opportunity to demonstrate my technical skills through this coding challenge! This README will walk you through my typical process when creating a project from scratch and outline the priorities and future enhancements I considered during development.

## Preview of App

## Process
1. Research and Documentation
- Every successful project starts with a documentation deep dive! I began by exploring the public weather and geocoding REST APIs. By examining the data, I imagined various use cases for a weather app from the user's perspective. This approach helped me determine the critical data to display and allowed me to draft a data schema for the project.
2. Design Inspiration
- I'll be honest, I seek design inspiration from existing apps and websites to enhance the UI/UX. I particularly enjoy using Dribble for design ideas, which helped me conceptualize a visually appealing and functional weather app.
3. Wireframing
- With a general UI in mind, I created a wireframe using Miro. This step ensured a clear visual representation of the app's layout and user flow before diving into the code.
4. Development
- I started coding by creating a static layout, focusing on the structure and appearance. Once the layout was finalized, I integrated the network requests to make the page dynamic and functional.

## Priorities
My top priority as a software engineer is always to achieve the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) on or before the deadline. Given the tight timeframe (Wednesday evening to Friday morning) and my full-time job at Ascent Integrated Tech, I had to prioritize getting the project done over doing everything I typically would for a full project. If I had more time, I would prioritize the following:

1. Responsiveness
- I like to adopt a mobile-first approach and use media queries to ensure the layout is responsive across all devices. However, for this challenge, I focused on optimizing the desktop experience since that's how it will be presented.
2. Testing
- Given more time, I would write End-to-End tests using Cypress. Cypress allows me to mock network requests and validate the app's behavior in various scenarios, ensuring reliability and robustness.
3. Performance Testing
- I utilize Google Lighthouse for performance audits, which helps me enhance the app's speed, performance, and overall user experience. This step is crucial for delivering a high-quality product.

## Future Enhancements
While developing this app, I envisioned several features I would have loved to include if I had more time:

- Day/Night UI: Implementing different UIs for daytime and nighttime to provide a more immersive experience.
- Weather Animations: Adding animations corresponding to the day's weather (e.g., rain and lightning animations for rainy days) to make the app more engaging.

## Conclusion
Thank you again for this opportunity. This project reflects my commitment to delivering quality work within tight deadlines and my enthusiasm for continuous improvement. I look forward to presenting this project to you!
